# Telegram logs notifications bot
## About
It's a Telegram bot written in Python that monitors log files and sends new log messages to all subscribed users (with needed log level (currently ERROR, INFO or DEBUG)).

It's based on aiogram and uses the watchdog module to monitor file changes. Sample logs are generated by a simple Go script.

## Running
You need Docker Compose to run two containers:
- The first container is main with bot. It monitors ./logs/logs.log file in shared volume.
- The second one is additional with the Go program. It generates random logs to ./logs/logs.log file in shared volume.

They can be started using a command:
```bash
docker compose up
```

## How to use
Just add a container with your app to docker-compose.yml and write your logs to shared volume. Time is presented in RFC3339 format. Don't forget to create bot/TOKEN.txt with your Telegram bot token.

## P.S.
The project was created for [VK Education course](https://education.vk.company/curriculum/program/discipline/2214/).
